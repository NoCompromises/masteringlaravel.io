            <p>
              How do you really know your Laravel app is secure? Education is
              key. But, documentation can be boring, and security analyzers have
              a high learning curve.
            </p>
            <p>
              That’s why Aaron built the Secure Coding in Laravel video course
              and published it on the Infosec Institute Skills learning
              platform.

            <p>
              The Infosec Institute Skills platform is a subscription service
              where you can get this course and many others for a single monthly
              or yearly fee.
            </p>

            <h3>What do I get with this video course?</h3>

            <p>
              Laravel is pretty secure out of the box using its default
              configuration. But, how many of our apps are just plain and simple
              CRUD with no customizations? That’s why in this video course
              you’ll get…
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">
              Over 4.5 hours of course content - with no filler
            </h4>
            <p>
              Most of us hate to have to play our videos at 1.5x speed to not
              get bored. Almost feels like you’ve been cheated. Not with this
              course. Aaron keeps a fast pace while presenting lots of
              information and detail. (hey - it’s totally fine to pause a
              video…)
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">The chance to practice what you’ve learned</h4>
            <p>
              This course comes with a final project that helps you practice
              implementing everything you’ve just learned. Don’t worry, though,
              you’re not left high and dry. There are instructions and hints for
              the solution. In fact, all of the final project is tested with
              unit tests so you know you’ve done it right.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">A wide range of security topics</h4>
            <p>These are just some of the things we’ll be covering:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Protecting Secrets / Reducing Information Leakage</li>
              <li>Validation</li>
              <li>Authentication and Authorization</li>
              <li>Database and Eloquent Security</li>
              <li>Rate Limiting</li>
              <li>CSRF, XSS and Header Security</li>
              <li>Security Scanning Tools</li>
              <li>Honey pots and Tripwires</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="mt-4">
              And access to 1,200+ other courses, cyber ranges and labs
            </h4>
            <p>
              Aaron has partnered with Infosec Institute to release this on
              their Skills platform. With your subscription, you get access to
              other courses for different languages, certification prep courses,
              and labs to practice your ethical hacking skills. It’s a bargain
              just to get the Secure Coding in Laravel course, but you don’t
              have to stop there!
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">Let’s get learning</h3>

                on any subscription
              </li>

                and start learning
              </li>

              use code <strong>AARONSARAY</strong> to save 50%
            </div>

            <p>
              If you get a yearly subscription, you’ll save $149 on your first
              invoice. For a monthly subscription, you’ll only save $17.

                Why did you host your course with Infosec Institute?
              </summary>
              <p>
                For two reasons, honestly. First, they came to Aaron at the
                right time when he had the stongest desire to start making
                Laravel security content. But second, and more importantly, he
                really loved the idea you could get access to his content along
                side of other things like Security+ training and CISSP courses.
              </p>
            </details>

            <details class="mb-2">
              <summary>How does the discount work?</summary>
              <p>
                It's easy. You enter
                <strong>AARONSARAY</strong> when you sign up and you save 50% of
                your first invoice. If you're subscribing yearly, which we
                recommend so you have enough time to watch this course and
                discover others, you'll save $149 on the first year. If you only
                subscribe monthly, you save $17 on the first month. In full
                disclosure, Aaron also get some compensation for you using his
                coupon code.

                We get it - we do! Laravel is pretty secure out of the box - and
                you're busy making new things. This almost seems boring and not
                necessary. But trust me, that's not the case. We could write a
                bunch more here to try to convince you - but that probably
                wouldn't help. We would love to hear from you, though, if you
                have any unique reasons for not wanting to learn more about
                securing your Laravel app.
